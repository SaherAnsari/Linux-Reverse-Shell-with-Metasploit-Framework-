# Linux Reverse Shell with Metasploit Framework :

This project demonstrates a basic penetration testing technique that leverages the Metasploit Framework to create and deliver a reverse shell payload to a target Linux machine. The payload is generated in the ELF format (Executable and Linkable Format) suitable for Linux systems and served using the Apache web server. Upon execution on the target machine, it connects back to the attackerâ€™s machine, providing a Meterpreter session for remote control.




## Requirments:

Run this before running the shell script

```bash
   sudo su  
```
